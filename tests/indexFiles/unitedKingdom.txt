leaders of devolved administrations northern ireland executive scottish government and welsh government the scottish parliament building in holyrood is the seat of the scottish parliament scotland wales and northern ireland each have their own government or executive led by a first minister or in the case of northern ireland a diarchal first minister and deputy first minister and a devolved unicameral legislature england the largest country of the united kingdom has no devolved executive or legislature and is administered and legislated for directly by the uk s government and parliament on all issues this situation has given rise to the so called west lothian question which concerns the fact that members of parliament from scotland wales and northern ireland can vote sometimes decisively 91 212 93 on matters that affect only england 91 213 93 the 2013 mckay commission on this recommended that laws affecting only england should need support from a majority of english members

those devolved to scotland the executive is led by a diarchy representing unionist and nationalist members of the assembly 91 219 93 devolution to northern ireland is contingent on participation by the northern ireland administration in the north south ministerial council where the northern ireland executive cooperates and develops joint and shared policies with the government of ireland the british and irish governments co operate on non devolved matters affecting northern ireland through the british–irish intergovernmental conference which assumes the responsibilities of the northern ireland administration in the event of its non operation 91 citation needed 93 the uk does not have a codified constitution and constitutional matters are not among the powers devolved to scotland wales or northern ireland under the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty the uk parliament could in theory therefore abolish the scottish parliament senedd or northern ireland assembly 91 220 93 91 221 93 indeed in 1972 the uk parliament unilaterally prorogued the parliament of northern ireland setting a precedent relevant to contemporary devolved institutions 91 222 93 in practice it would be politically difficult for the uk parliament to abolish devolution to the scottish parliament and the senedd given the political entrenchment created by referendum decisions 91 223 93 the political constraints placed upon the uk parliament s power to interfere with devolution in northern ireland are even greater than in relation to scotland and wales given that devolution in northern ireland

the approach taken in the legislation the scottish parliament is not to be seen as a reflection of the settled will of the people of scotland or of popular sovereignty but as a reflection of its subordination to a higher legal authority following the logic of this argument the power of the scottish parliament to legislate can be withdrawn or overridden elliot m 2004 united kingdom parliamentary sovereignty under pressure international journal of constitutional law 2 3 545–627 553–554 doi 10 1093 icon 2 3 545 notwithstanding substantial differences among the schemes an important common factor is that the u k parliament has not renounced legislative sovereignty in relation to the three nations concerned for example the scottish parliament is empowered to enact primary legislation on all matters save those in relation to which competence is explicitly denied 160 but this power to legislate on what may be termed devolved matters is concurrent with the westminster parliament s general power to legislate for scotland on any matter at all including devolved matters 160 in theory therefore westminster may legislate on scottish devolved matters whenever it chooses

1 19–35 p 29 doi 10 1093 publius pjj011 the british parliament has the power to abolish the scottish parliament and the welsh assembly by a simple majority vote in both houses but since both were sanctioned by referenda it would be politically difficult to abolish them without the sanction of a further vote by the people in this way several of the constitutional measures introduced by the blair government appear to be entrenched and not subject to a simple exercise of parliamentary sovereignty at westminster meehan e 1999 the belfast agreement – its distinctiveness and points of cross fertilization in the uk s devolution programme parliamentary affairs 52 1 19–31 p 23 doi 10 1093 pa 52 1 19 t he distinctive involvement of two governments in the northern irish problem means that northern ireland s new arrangements rest upon an intergovernmental agreement if this can be equated with a treaty it could be argued that the forthcoming distribution of power between westminster and belfast has similarities with divisions specified in the written constitutions of federal states although the agreement makes the general proviso that westminster s powers to make legislation for northern ireland remains unaffected without an explicit categorical reference to reserved matters it may be more difficult than in scotland or wales for devolved powers to be repatriated the retraction of devolved powers would not merely entail consultation in northern ireland backed implicitly by the absolute power of parliamentary sovereignty but also the renegotiation of an
